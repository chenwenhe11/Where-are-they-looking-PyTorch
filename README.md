# Where are they looking?

This repository contains an implementation of the "Where are they looking?" paper by A. Recasens*, A. Khosla*, C. Vondrick and A. Torralba.

## Introduction

A deep neural network-based approach for gaze-following automated using a SSD face detector.

NOTE: This was one of my first deep learning projects and it has some bugs. The problems are currently being fixed so that the results in the paper can be attained. Please stay tuned! Thanks!

## Installation

- [Pytorch 1.1 & Torchvision](https://pytorch.org/)

## Usage

python3 main.py --data_dir=`location to gazefollow dataset` --placesmodelpath=`location to places365 alexnet model`


* Please check out opts.py for other parameter changing.

### Results on GazeDataset

* Min Euclidean Distance:
* Euclidean Distance:
* AUC Score:
