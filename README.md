# SMAI17
Where are they looking? - Attention modelling + Deep Learning

TODO:

Add Visualization and conversion of fc output to x, y coordinates to make sure network is learning stuff xD

Add AUC Score

Try training model and getting it to learn

Make sure we follow same x, y scheme throughout all the code (matlab -> python style)
and all .views() are fine and double check shifted grid part of the code

Note to my teammates: do bash clean.sh before pushing please xD
